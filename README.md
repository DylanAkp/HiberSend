## ‚ùì Why

I've made this simple script to fastly share files from Windows.
And because I love Hiberfile

## üöÄ Quick start

### Getting Started On Windows

1. Clone the repository or download it

2. Execute install.ps1 (Right-click on it, Execute with powershell)
   
3. When the script ask to install Node, do it, then click "OK"

4. Accept to add the entry to Windows Registry

### Getting Started On Linux

For linux users using Nautilus, use these 3 commands :

`npm install hibercli`

`echo "gnome-terminal -- hibercli --upload ${NAUTILUS_SCRIPT_SELECTED_FILE_PATHS}" > ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/HiberSend`

`chmod 777 ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/HiberSend`
