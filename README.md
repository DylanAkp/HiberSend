## ‚ùì Why

I've made this simple script to fastly share files from Windows.
And because I love Hiberfile

## üöÄ Quick start

### Getting Started On Windows

1. Clone the repository or download it

2. Execute install.ps1 (Right-click on it, Execute with powershell)
   
3. When the script ask to install Node, do it, then click "OK"

4. Accept to add the entry to Windows Registry

### Getting Started On Linux

For linux users using Nautilus (tested on debian/ubuntu only)

```./linux-install```
